When you work with pandas and yfincce it stores the time info in a timestamp
to convert this timestamp to a datetime pandas object, so you can access methods like
.date(), .day(), .(hour) and so on you have to convert it into a datetime object
to do so you can use this simple syntax

access the timestamp object

ex:

microsoft = yf.Ticker('MSFT')

msft_history = microsoft.history('1d', '1h')

# print(msft_history.index.tolist())

for item in msft_history.index.tolist():
    # The first object is a timestamp
    print(item)
    # The second object is a datetime
    print(item.to_pydatetime())
    print()

The function that we have used is the

datetime = timestamp.to_pydatetime()

after that we can use the datetime.date()
to display just the date.

datetime.time()
to display the time

datetime.hour
to display the hour

and so on...

You can even apply the changes straight into the column, and not on every item
individually
